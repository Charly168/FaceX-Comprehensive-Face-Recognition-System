# FaceX-Comprehensive-Face-Recognition-System
This repository will utilize various algorithms for face recognition.

## Feature Extraction Algorithms

In addition to PCA, there are several other feature extraction algorithms that can be used for face recognition, such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Haar features, Gabor filters, etc. These algorithms extract local textures, edges, and patches from images to represent and identify faces.

## Face Alignment Algorithms

Face alignment is an important preprocessing step in face recognition, aiming to align key points of faces in images to fixed positions and poses. Common face alignment algorithms include those based on feature points and those based on facial regions.

## Template Matching Algorithms

Template matching is a pixel-level similarity-based matching algorithm that identifies faces by comparing a small face template with local regions in images. Common template matching algorithms include intersection/similarity matching, correlation coefficient matching, etc.
